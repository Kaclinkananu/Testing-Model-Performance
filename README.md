# Testing-Model-Performance
I used the train-test split technique to separate a dataset into training and testing sets and use them to train and test the performance of the model created.
OBJECTIVE
* Create separate train and test sets for both the predictor and response variables.
* Train a model on the training data.
* Assess and compare the model's performance on both the training and testing sets
